			My work explores the relationship between postmodern discourse and life as performance. 
			With influences as diverse as Kafka and Francis Bacon, new insights are crafted from both constructed and discovered narratives. 
		</p>
		<p>    
			Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the endless oscillation of relationships. What starts out as 
			contemplation soon becomes corrupted into a manifesto of distress, leaving only a sense of nihilism and the dawn of a new order. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As temporal forms become transformed through studious and critical practice, 
			the viewer is left with an insight into the darkness of our era.
